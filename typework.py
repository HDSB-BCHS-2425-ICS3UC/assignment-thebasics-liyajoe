#Description: Different types of data types

#These variables store examples of the data types
integer = 9
float = 2.5
string = "cookie"
boolean = True
char = 'g'

#These variables have the definitions of the different data types
integer_meaning = "a positive or negative whole number"
float_meaning = "a number with a decimal"
string_meaning = "a combination of characters"
boolean_meaning = "true or false"
char_meaning = "a single character"

#These are print statements that tell the user about a data type and give an example
print(f"Here all the different types of data types in Python:\n")
print(f"We're gonna start with an integer. An integer is {integer_meaning}, such as '{integer}'.")
print(f"A float is {float_meaning}, like '{float}'.")
print(f"A string is {string_meaning}, for example '{string}'.")
print(f"A boolean means {boolean_meaning}, so '{boolean}' is a boolean!")
print(f"Lastly, a char is {char_meaning}, such as '{char}'.")
